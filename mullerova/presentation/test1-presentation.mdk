## Introduction

**FLASHOVER**  is near-simultaneous ignition of most of the directly exposed combustible material in an enclosed area.
The criteria for flashover usually require:

* To achieve a temperature among 500-600 °C 
* Min. heat flux on the floor 15 to 20 kW. m^-2^ 
* Min. mass burnt per second: 40−80 g/s
* Critic temp. under ceiling:  600 ℃, 
* Flame tongues from the vents, 
* Heat instability (among HRR and Heat losts) 

**PREDICTING** the flashover appearance is the key to prevent severe accidents affecting fire fighters.

**MOTIVATION**:

* Early warning of Flashover = save lives
* Increasing fire safety of buildings

## Construction of 3D models
Detection of interdependence between the relevant periods and time differences of selected observable indicators flashover phenomenon in the form of correlations at different fire load and fuel type.

The experimental fire tests:

* Temperature changes related to time of flashover appearance.
* Analysis of the emissions released by combustion of fuel used.
* The fuel burning rate during flashover.
* Heat flux at floor level during flashover.

Observable variables:

* Time when the flames reached the ceiling in the fire area.
* Time at which flames appeared in the vents.
* Time to reach flashover phenomenon.
* Time to the heat flow of 20 kW.m-2 at the floor level.

## 3D small-scale modeling

* Only some properties can be properly observed.

## 3D small-scale modeling

Small scale modelling rules by Peter Veloo:

1. Small-scale model, in reduction scale of 4:1 must be based on real experiments conducted in full scale.
2. Reducement rules (laws) stated in theory must be followed.
3. Fuel load must represent a realistic fire load.
4. The combustion duration of fuel pack (crib) in full-scale (prototype) need to be 1 hour.
5. Prisms in the fuel package must be layered in at least 2 layers.
6. The fuel pack must burn in a heavily controlled mode - densely packed package.

We have applied also Pericone’s time scaling, where the experiment time is calculated as a square root of scale (t ~ s^1/2^) This equation gives very exact results of modeling.
